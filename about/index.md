Hello! My name is Yi-Wei Liao. I am a undergraduate student(junior) who double major in Economic & Computer Science in National Taipei University.
I will share some notes and articles on my study about programming because I want more people to learn the programming language simply.
Thank you for reading and leaving a comment.
